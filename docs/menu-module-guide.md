## File And Image Access On Deployment

Uploaded files are stored in Laravel under:

```text
storage/app/public
```

The app serves them through:

```text
/media/{path}
```

Examples:

```text
/media/products/product-image.png
/media/supplier-documents/blank-cheques/cheque.png
/media/vendor-invoices/invoice.pdf
```

This avoids using `/storage/...` directly on hosting environments where the real `storage` directory is blocked by the web server.
